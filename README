ExcelANT
VBScript build tool, similar to NAnt, MSBuild and other related projects.

Despite it's name, ExcelANT isn't just for Excel, it will build a range of VBScript and VBA projects from source files.

The idea behind ExcelANT is to create an easy way of exporting code modules from your application as text files, so they can be easily stored in an SCM repository.

Like NAnt, it uses a .build file to define tasks to run. Generally the tasks are in pairs, one to save the code as text and another to import the source into a new or existing file. There may also be other utility tasks to do things like create directories, etc.

Tasks
PrintTask - A debugging task that echoes the supplied text.
PrintValuesTask - A debugging task that accepts a range of text values to echo.
ExtractVBSTask - Takes a VBScript file and extracts all the classes into separate .cls files and keeps all the remaining code as main.bas.
BuildVBSTask - Takes a list of files and imports them into a single, specified VBScript file, ready to be ran.

Other tasks, including Extracting and Building MS Access, MS Excel and MS Word files are under development.
